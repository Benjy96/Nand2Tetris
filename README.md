# Nand2Tetris
Projects from the online Nand2Tetris course on Coursera, which builds a computer from first principles

# Background / Goals

I am reading through CODE by Charles Petzold to understand computers from the atom up to high-level languages. 50 pages of notes and counting...

The projects in this course are based around creating arrangements of logic gates. For example, in project 02, you will find a file named "ALU.hdl", which mimics the behaviour of an Arithmetic Logic Unit in a processor. The course starts off by providing you a logical implementation of a NAND gate, and you must construct other gates from there in week 01, such as the AND and OR gates. You then go from here to build computer components through the coding language "HDL" - Hardware Description Language.

# Running the .HDL Files, which demonstrate logic gate / PC component behaviour

The .hdl files found under /projects are openable in the HardwareSimulator file found under the tools directory.
